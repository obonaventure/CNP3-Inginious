    TCP segments contain flags. These are defined in `Section 3.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1>`_ of `RFC793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_.

    The segment below was sent by a client to create a TCP connection towards a web server. Ingicated the values of the SYN, URG, PSH, ACK, FIN and RST flags inside this segment (1 means set and 0 means reset)?

        header: This segment was sent by a client to create a TCP connection towards
            a web server. What are the flags that must be set inside this segment
            ?
        range: transport
        feedback:
            ACK: The ACK flag is only set when the segment contains a valid acknowledgement
                number. This is not the case in the initial segment sent by a client.
            FIN: The RST flag is used to gracefully terminate a connection, not to
                create one.
            PSH: The PSH flag is only associated with data. It is never set in the
                first segment sent to create a TCP connection.
            RST: The RST flag is used to abruptly terminate a connection, not to create
                one.
            SYN: The SYN flag is set in the first segment sent to initiate a TCP connection
                as described in `Section 3.7 of RFC 793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.4>`_.
            URG: The URG flag is only set in Urgent data as described in `Section
                3.7 of RFC 793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.4>`_.
                It is never set in the first segment sent to create a TCP connection.
